      "This app lets you have a custom hotkey linked to one of your custom playlists in Spotify that would take the current song you're listening to, and put that on the playlist for you. This allows you not have to re-open Spotify to like/save a song. I wrote this simple script because I found it annoying that I had to re-open Spotify just to save a song that I liked. I did not want to interrupt my workflow but at the same time didn't want to miss a cool track either! ",
    small_description:
      "The application utilizes the Spotify API by authorizing the user, while running a hotkey thread in the background, so that the hotkey would work globally. The main purpose of the application is to allow users to like / save the songs they're listening to without interrupting their workflow (without having to switch to the Spotify window). ",

      'Discode is an open-source node-based discord bot builder created with the sole aim of being as simple as possible. This app is best suited for simple bots, and creating highly complex bots is not advisable. Through a collection of logical and action-based nodes, you can create simple discord bot logic with no code experience required. The app is simply like a "scratch" for Discord bots, allowing users with no coding experience to have a bot of their own.  ',

The application uses a locally running server to host the bot in the background, which users can turn on or off or reload based on the changes you make to the bot\'s logic.
